"""Advanced in-memory rate-limiting strategies: token bucket and sliding window.

Why the simple IP-based fixed-window approach (v1) is often insufficient
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed-window (slowapi default) counts requests in a calendar window (e.g., "this
minute").  Two attacks bypass it easily:

1. Window-boundary burst: send 1 000 requests at 00:59 → 0 blocked; send another
   1 000 at 01:01 → 0 blocked.  In 2 seconds the client sent 2 000 requests while
   the limit was supposedly 1 000/min.

2. VPN / shared IPs: a single residential VPN exit node may represent thousands of
   real users.  Blocking the IP blocks everyone behind it, while sophisticated
   clients trivially rotate IPs.

Better algorithms implemented here
------------------------------------
TokenBucketLimiter  — burst-tolerant, smooth throughput guarantee
SlidingWindowLimiter — exact rolling window, eliminates boundary attack

Production note
---------------
Both implementations use in-memory Python dicts.  In a multi-worker deployment
replace the dicts/deques with Redis and atomic Lua scripts (or use
`limits.storage.RedisStorage`).  The *algorithm* stays identical; only the storage
backend changes.

class TokenBucketLimiter:
    """Per-key token bucket rate limiter.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    Each client key (IP, user ID, API key…) owns a virtual "bucket" of tokens.

      • Capacity  — maximum tokens the bucket can hold = the burst limit.
      • Refill    — tokens added per second at a steady rate.
      • Consume   — each request costs 1 token.  If the bucket is empty → 429.

    Why it beats fixed-window
    -------------------------
    • No thundering herd at window reset: clients that are idle accumulate tokens
      and can burst, but only up to `capacity`, not 2× the limit.
    • Steady-state throughput is guaranteed: sustained traffic is throttled at
      exactly `refill_per_second` req/s.
    • Bursty but well-behaved clients (e.g., a mobile app that batches n requests)
      are not unfairly penalised.

    Trade-off: burst capacity means the *peak* rate > the *steady* rate, which may
    not be desirable for pricing-sensitive APIs.

    Production swap

class SlidingWindowLimiter:
    """Per-key sliding (rolling) window rate limiter.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    For each client key, maintain a deque of request timestamps.  On each
    incoming request:

      1. Drop timestamps older than (now - window_seconds)  ← O(evictions)
      2. If len(deque) < limit → allow, append now
      3. Else → deny

    Why it beats fixed-window
    -------------------------
    Fixed-window boundary attack: with a 60-second window and limit=100:

        00:00 - 00:59   → 100 requests (window A fills)
        01:00            window resets
        01:00 - 01:01   → 100 more requests (burst)

    In 2 seconds the client sends 200 requests despite a 100/min limit.
    Sliding window prevents this: the window moves with *now*, so the same
    100 requests at 00:59 are still "in scope" at 01:01.

    Trade-off: higher memory per key (O(limit) timestamps vs O(1) counter for
    fixed window).  For very large limits (e.g., 10 000/hour), a count-based
    approximation (sliding window counter) is preferred.

    ZADD for append, ZCARD for count).  A single Lua script makes it atomic.
