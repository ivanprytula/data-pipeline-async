## SQL Patterns Checklist (40 Extended)

**✓ = Implemented in code; ○ = Understood; ✗ = Need review**

### Foundations (1–5)

- [ ] SELECT/WHERE/ORDER BY/LIMIT/OFFSET
- [ ] DISTINCT, NULL handling (IS NULL, COALESCE, NULLIF)
- [ ] CASE/WHEN/ELSE conditional logic
- [ ] ORDER BY ASC/DESC with multiple columns
- [ ] Debugging with LIMIT and OFFSET

### Joins (6–10)

- [ ] INNER JOIN (only matches)
- [ ] LEFT JOIN (all left + matches)
- [ ] RIGHT JOIN (all right + matches)
- [ ] FULL OUTER JOIN (all from both)
- [ ] CROSS JOIN (Cartesian product)

### Grouping & Aggregation (11–15)

- [ ] GROUP BY with HAVING filters
- [ ] COUNT(*), COUNT(col), SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
- [ ] STRING_AGG, ARRAY_AGG (group-level concatenation)
- [ ] GROUP BY multiple columns
- [ ] Aggregate window functions

### Subqueries (16–20)

- [ ] Scalar subquery (single value in WHERE/SELECT)
- [ ] IN subquery (matching multiple values)
- [ ] EXISTS subquery (efficient membership test)
- [ ] NOT IN / NOT EXISTS (inverted logic)
- [ ] Correlated subquery (references outer table, slower)

### Common Table Expressions (21–25)

- [ ] WITH (CTE) basic syntax
- [ ] Multiple CTEs (chain WITH clauses)
- [ ] Recursive CTE (hierarchies, tree walks)
- [ ] CTE vs subquery trade-offs
- [ ] CTE with window functions combined

### Set Operations (26–28)

- [ ] UNION (combine, remove duplicates)
- [ ] UNION ALL (combine, keep duplicates)
- [ ] EXCEPT / INTERSECT (set difference/intersection)

### Window Functions (29–35)

- [ ] ROW_NUMBER() (sequential rank)
- [ ] RANK() / DENSE_RANK() (tied ranks)
- [ ] LAG / LEAD (access prev/next row)
- [ ] FIRST_VALUE / LAST_VALUE (boundary values)
- [ ] PARTITION BY / ORDER BY (window frames)
- [ ] Running aggregate (cumulative SUM)
- [ ] PERCENTILE functions (analytics)

### Indexing & Query Planning (36–38)

- [ ] Composite index (multi-column, prefix subsets)
- [ ] Partial index (WHERE clause, reduced size)
- [ ] Covering index (INCLUDE clause, no table lookup)

### Advanced Patterns (39–40)

- [ ] Keyset pagination (WHERE id > cursor, faster than OFFSET)
- [ ] EXPLAIN ANALYZE (query plans, seq scan vs index scan)

---

## Pytest Fixtures (10)

- [ ] `async_session` — AsyncSession for database tests
- [ ] `client` — HTTPClient/AsyncClient for API tests
- [ ] `mock_external_api` — Mock external HTTP calls
- [ ] `fixture_with_cleanup` — Ensure cleanup runs after test
- [ ] `parametrized_fixture` — @pytest.mark.parametrize patterns
- [ ] `fixture_scope` — function vs session vs module scopes
- [ ] `tmp_file_fixture` — Temporary file creation
- [ ] `time_travel_fixture` — freezegun time manipulation
- [ ] `caplog_fixture` — Capture log output
- [ ] `db_transaction_rollback` — Isolation in tests (rollback after each test)

---

## Async Gotchas (5)

| Gotcha | Problem | Fix | Example |
|--------|---------|-----|---------|
| **Greenlet without event loop** | AttributeError accessing model after commit | Set `expire_on_commit=False` on AsyncSessionLocal | `sessionmaker(..., expire_on_commit=False)` |
| **Sync code in async** | Event loop blocks, app hangs | Use `asyncio.to_thread(sync_func)` | `await asyncio.to_thread(blocking_db_call)` |
| **Task not awaited** | Warning, function doesn't run | Always `await` or `asyncio.create_task()` | `await coroutine()` not `coroutine()` |
| **Cancellation not propagated** | Task keeps running after cancel | Check `current_task().cancel()`, handle CancelledError | `try: ... except asyncio.CancelledError:` |
| **Event loop closed** | RuntimeError after test cleanup | Use `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pytest.ini | `asyncio_mode = auto` in pyproject.toml |
