# Online and Cloud Services and Accounts for Long-Term Project Operation

## Purpose

This document is the long-term reference for all external services, accounts, and paid tools required to build, ship, secure, and operate this project.

Use it as:

- onboarding checklist for new maintainers
- billing visibility document
- operations ownership matrix
- periodic maintenance checklist

## Scope

Covers services required to:

- develop and collaborate
- run CI/CD
- deploy and host runtime workloads
- observe and secure production
- support incident response and reliability

## Must-Have Account Setup

## 1. GitHub

Create and maintain:

- repository owner/organization account
- branch protection rules for main and develop
- GitHub Environments: dev, prod
- repository variables and secrets
- Dependabot enabled for actions and dependencies

Critical configuration:

- enforce required status checks before merge
- restrict direct pushes to protected branches
- enforce least-privilege workflow permissions

## 2. AWS Foundation

Create and maintain:

- one AWS account minimum (prefer separate dev/prod accounts)
- IAM Identity Center users/groups/permission sets
- OIDC federation from GitHub to AWS IAM roles
- ECR repositories for service images
- S3 + DynamoDB for Terraform remote state
- VPC/networking + ECS/EKS runtime resources

Primary region:

- eu-central-1

Recommended account model:

- data-zoo-dev
- data-zoo-prod

## 3. Domain and TLS

Create and maintain:

- DNS hosted zone (Route 53 or external provider)
- ACM certificates in deployment region
- validation records and renewal monitoring

## 4. CI/CD Security and Artifact Chain

Create and maintain:

- GitHub Actions OIDC role mapping per environment
- cosign signing and verification path
- dependency-review + CodeQL workflows
- immutable digest-based image promotion

## 5. Observability and Incident Stack

Create and maintain:

- CloudWatch log groups and alarm baselines
- Prometheus/Grafana dashboards (self-hosted or managed)
- Sentry project and environment mapping
- PagerDuty/Opsgenie escalation policy
- Slack/Teams alert routing channels

## Ownership Matrix

| Domain | Owner | Backup Owner | Review Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub org/repo admin | Platform/Admin | Tech Lead | Monthly |
| AWS org/accounts/IAM | Cloud/Admin | Security Lead | Monthly |
| CI/CD workflows | Platform | Senior Backend Engineer | Per PR + monthly |
| Terraform state and access | Platform | Cloud/Admin | Monthly |
| Runtime infrastructure (ECS/EKS) | Platform | SRE/DevOps | Weekly |
| Security scanners and policies | Security | Platform | Weekly |
| Monitoring/alerting | SRE/Platform | Backend Lead | Weekly |
| Incident tooling | SRE | Platform | Quarterly |

## Cost Planning and Budget Buckets

Track spend in these buckets:

1. Core cloud runtime (compute, storage, networking)
2. CI/CD and developer platform (GitHub Actions minutes/storage)
3. Security tooling (Snyk/SonarCloud and related services)
4. Observability (logs, metrics, tracing, error monitoring)
5. Incident response and communication tooling

Practical budget controls:

- set AWS Budgets with monthly alert thresholds
- separate tags/cost allocation per environment
- cap log retention where possible
- use non-prod scaling policies aggressively in dev

## Ongoing Maintenance Checklist

## Daily

- review failed deployments and critical alerts
- triage dependency/security workflow failures

## Weekly

- review cloud spend anomalies
- review open Dependabot PRs and merge safe updates
- verify backup/restore and alert routing are healthy

## Monthly

- rotate or validate high-risk credentials/tokens if any remain
- audit IAM roles and least-privilege policy drift
- verify GitHub branch protection and environment rules
- review observability noise and adjust alert thresholds

## Quarterly

- disaster recovery drill (at least tabletop)
- dependency and tool vendor reassessment
- CI/CD control audit (signing, verification, permissions)

## Setup Checklist (One-Time)

| Setup Item | Create Now | Can Defer | Free Tier / Low Cost | Owner | Current Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub repository governance baseline | Yes | No | Partial | Platform/Admin | Partial | Workflows, required-check scripts, and environment scaffolding exist. Branch protection is not fully applied yet. |
| AWS account structure for dev/prod | Yes if deploying to cloud soon | Yes if staying local-only | No | Cloud/Admin | Partial | Repo assumes `dev` and `prod`, but actual AWS account separation is not verified from the repo. |
| IAM Identity Center and permission sets | No | Yes | Yes for service itself | Cloud/Admin | Not started / not verified | No repo evidence of Identity Center setup. Needed once multiple human operators need controlled AWS access. |
| GitHub OIDC trust and deploy roles | Yes before push/promote/deploy | No once cloud deploy starts | Yes for OIDC itself | Platform/Admin + Cloud/Admin | Partial | Workflows are wired for OIDC, but AWS auth inputs are still incomplete in GitHub configuration. |
| ECR repositories for all service images | Yes before image push/promotion | Yes if only building locally | No | Platform/Admin | Partial | CI/build/promotion now support `ingestor`, `inference`, `analytics`, `processor`, and `dashboard`, but ECR presence is not verified from the repo. |
| Terraform backend (S3 + DynamoDB lock table) | Yes before shared Terraform use | Yes if Terraform is not being applied yet | Low cost | Platform/Admin | Not verified | Documented in cloud setup docs, but live backend provisioning is not visible from this repo alone. |
| DNS and ACM certificates | Yes before public environment exposure | Yes for local-only or private dev | ACM public certs are low/no direct cost; DNS is paid | Cloud/Admin | Not started / not verified | Needed for public HTTPS endpoints, ALB routing, and stable domains. |
| GitHub environments `dev` / `prod` | Yes | No | Yes | Platform/Admin | Partial | Environments exist and now contain per-service ECS variable names, but approval rules and deploy secrets are still incomplete. |
| Monitoring, error tracking, and incident routing | No for initial local-only development | Yes | Mixed | SRE/Platform | Partial | CloudWatch, Prometheus/Grafana, and security workflows are represented in repo docs/workflows; Sentry/PagerDuty/Slack setup is not verified. |
| Budget alerts and ownership rotation | No for earliest prototype stage | Yes | Yes / low cost | Cloud/Admin + Platform/Admin | Not started / not verified | Should be added before sustained cloud usage to prevent silent spend growth. |

Status legend:

- `Not started / not verified`: no reliable repo evidence that the external setup exists yet
- `Partial`: repo wiring or docs exist, but the external account/service setup is still incomplete
- `Ready`: both repo wiring and external setup are in place

## Optional but High-Value Services

Adopt when team/project complexity grows:

- Terraform Cloud/Spacelift for policy-based IaC operations
- Snyk for broader supply chain visibility
- SonarCloud for quality gate governance
- Codecov for strict test coverage management
