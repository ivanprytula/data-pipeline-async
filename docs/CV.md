## Key Achievements (Impact-Focused)

### Critical Problem Diagnosis → Prevention

**Trading Bot Failure Prevention** (LumenGlobal)
- **Situation**: Binance API changes could break trading bot order execution without warning
- **Action**: Established API changelog monitoring system, analyzed impact on codebase
- **Impact**: Identified and communicated breaking changes to product team BEFORE going to production
- **Outcome**: Proactive code adjustments prevented potential order execution failures; zero production bot failures
- **Technical Depth**: Analyzed 15+ bot repositories, coordinated cross-team rollout, implemented monitoring alerts

**System Reliability Recovery** (LumenGlobal)
- **Situation**: 5–7 service restarts per week due to database connection pool exhaustion
- **Root Cause**: SQLAlchemy pool configuration too small; health checks not detecting stale connections
- **Solution**: Tuned pool size, implemented connection health checks, added monitoring alerts
- **Metrics**:
  - Before: 5+ weekly restarts, 10–15 min downtime per incident
  - After: Zero restarts in 8+ weeks, system stable across QA/prod
- **Learning**: Documented connection pooling patterns for team reference

### Complex Feature Delivery (Architecture + Implementation)

**Trade Force-Exit Workflow Redesign** (LumenGlobal)
- **Problem**: Inconsistent state during force-exit, leading to UI sync failures and trading confusion
- **Redesign**:
  - Atomic database transactions for state transitions
  - Idempotent message processing (prevent double-processing)
  - Clear state machine (pending → executing → completed/failed)
- **Result**: Eliminated edge cases, improved test coverage, enabled QA to verify complex scenarios
- **Technical Pattern**: Applied idempotency and state machine patterns (now documented in Data Zoo)

**REST API for Multi-Tenant Access Control** (BIT Studios)
- **Scope**: Role-based APIs serving 100+ business accounts
- **Complexity**: Admin dashboard + customer-facing API with different permission models
- **Solution**: Designed permission hierarchy (global → org → team → resource), implemented via middleware
- **Result**: Enabled new product lines (admin, customer portals, API clients)
- **Integration**: Connected external services (Zoom, Microsoft Graph) via OAuth2 flows

### Production Reliability Improvements

**Database Query Optimization** (BIT Studios + ELEKS)
- **Problem**: API endpoints returning in 5–10 seconds due to inefficient ORM queries
- **Diagnosis**: Used Django Debug Toolbar, SQL profiling to identify N+1 queries and missing indexes
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Converted ORM queries to raw SQL where needed
  - Added composite indexes on frequently-joined columns
  - Implemented query result caching (1-hour TTL)
- **Metrics**: Average response time 5s → 200ms (25x improvement)
- **Learned**: Documented optimization workflow (now teaching in Data Zoo Phase 5)

**Async Task Processing System** (BIT Studios + ELEKS)
- **Scope**: Extended Celery for email notifications, scheduled reports, PDF generation
- **Challenges**: Ensuring reliable execution, handling retries, monitoring failures
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented exponential backoff retry logic
  - Set up task result caching (Celery result backend)
  - Created monitoring dashboard (failed tasks, queue depth)
- **Result**: 99.5%+ successful task execution; emails reliably delivered

### Cross-Team Enablement (Mentoring + Documentation)

**QA Team Infrastructure Training** (LumenGlobal)
- **Situation**: QA team struggled to debug complex trading scenarios, felt "blocked" by infrastructure
- **Action**:
  - Conducted training on Kubernetes logging, port-forwarding, log aggregation
  - Created runbooks for common debugging tasks (find specific trade, inspect state transitions)
  - Provided off-hours support for edge-case testing
- **Result**: QA became self-sufficient, could verify complex scenarios independently
- **Impact**: Reduced developer interruptions; improved feature quality

**Technical Documentation** (ELEKS + LumenGlobal)
- Created comprehensive guides for backtesting calculations (referenced by new devs and BA team)
- Documented API response formats and error codes (reduced support questions)
- Built internal dashboards for production monitoring (accessible to non-engineers)

## Interview Talking Points

**"Tell me about a time you diagnosed a production issue."**

→ "Discovered connection pool exhaustion causing weekly service restarts. Root cause: SQLAlchemy pool size too small + stale connections not detected. Fixed through pool tuning and health checks. Zero restarts after. Taught team the pattern."

**"What's your approach to slow queries?"**

→ "Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE. Check: sequential vs index scan, row selectivity, join order. Diagnose whether it's missing index or inefficient query logic. Add indexes only after confirming selectivity. Document the pattern for team."

**"How do you ensure system reliability?"**

→ "Combination: circuit breaker for external calls, DLQ for failed processing, backpressure to prevent queue overflow, async for I/O efficiency. Instrument everything (metrics, traces, logs). Alert on anomalies. Test failure scenarios before production."

**"Describe your experience with Kubernetes."**

→ "Deployed FastAPI services to Kubernetes via GitLab CI/CD. Configured resource requests/limits, health checks, scaling policies. Debugged pod issues using kubectl logs, port-forward. Familiar with cluster operations but not cluster setup/management."
